# ItemEditorJSON

Welcome to my project! 

I wanted to make something fun and useful. I decided to build a program that would help make work more streamlined as I'm building a multiplayer 2d game engine. Instead of writing all the information in text, this program puts visualization to what the item would look like, automatically chooses the right information needed for a specific type of weapon chosen, and stores it in a json that can be implemented directly into the server when being loaded. I have also added more on to it since the original conception. You can also play around with the monster editor and npc editor that is included.

Feature List:

1 - Create an additional class which inherits one or more properties from its parent.

2 - Create a dictionary or list, populate it with several values, retrieve at least one value, and use it in your program.

3 - Read data from an external file, such as text, JSON, CSV, etc and use that data in your application.

4 - Visualize data in a graph, chart, or other visual representation of data.

Information for loading project!

I have included the bin/debug folder which has the json files already populated with item information. You can choose to load right at the start to check them out or start making your own items. It will not let you load again unless you delete the items out of the item list or restart the program. When the program starts the Item Editor is the button you want to click. The other ones are additions I made to help in other, but similar aspects. I hope you enjoy this as much as I did in making it. Thank you!
