# ItemEditorJSON

Welcome to my project! 

I wanted to make something fun and useful. I decided to build a program that would help make work more streamlined as I'm building a multiplayer 2d game engine. Instead of writing all the information in text, this program puts visualization to what the item would look like, automatically chooses the right information needed for a specific type of weapon chosen, and stores it in a json that can be implemented directly into the server when being loaded.

Feature List:
1 - Create an additional class which inherits one or more properties from its parent.
2 - Create a dictionary or list, populate it with several values, retrieve at least one value, and use it in your program.
3 - Read data from an external file, such as text, JSON, CSV, etc and use that data in your application.
4 - Visualize data in a graph, chart, or other visual representation of data.
